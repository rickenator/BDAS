# BDAS Clock Application

## Introduction
The BDAS (Biological Daylight Adjustment System) Clock is an innovative timekeeping system designed to enhance human health by aligning daily activities with natural solar photoperiods. Unlike standard timekeeping, which is fixed and often misaligned with natural sunlight patterns, the BDAS clock dynamically adjusts the perceived length of hours to ensure that sunrise and sunset occur at consistent times throughout the year. This approach promotes better circadian rhythm alignment and overall well-being.

## Theory

Modern timekeeping, based on rigid time zones and standard daylight saving time (DST), often fails to align human activities with natural sunlight. This mismatch can disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to health problems such as sleep disturbances, reduced productivity, and even long-term health risks like cardiovascular disease.

The BDAS system addresses this by dynamically adjusting time dilation and contraction based on the solar cycle and geographic latitude. By compressing time during winter daylight hours and expanding it during winter nights, BDAS ensures that:

- Sunrise and sunset occur at approximately the same time year-round for each latitude band.
- The day-night cycle feels natural and is more consistent with the biological clock.

This dynamic adjustment promotes healthier sleep patterns, improved energy levels, and a stronger alignment with natural photoperiods.

## How It Works

### Key Features
1. **Latitude-Based Adjustments**:
   - The BDAS clock divides the Earth into latitude bands (e.g., Southern, Mid, Northern).
   - Each band has specific time dilation factors based on the day of the year.

2. **Dynamic Time Dilation**:
   - The length of daylight and nighttime hours is adjusted dynamically to reflect natural photoperiods.
   - For example, in winter, daytime hours are compressed to align with shorter daylight periods, while nighttime hours are expanded to match longer nights.

3. **Midnight Alignment**:
   - BDAS ensures that standard and BDAS midnights coincide, maintaining consistency across dates.

4. **Visualization**:
   - The application features analog and digital clocks to display both standard and BDAS time, with scaled second hands reflecting time dilation.

5. **Solar Event Consistency**:
   - Sunrise and sunset times are consistent year-round for each latitude band, promoting a regular schedule regardless of season.

### Operation
- The application retrieves the user's location via GPS to determine their latitude.
- Based on the latitude and current date, the app calculates time dilation factors and adjusts the BDAS clock accordingly.
- The clock dynamically updates every second, reflecting the adjusted time scale.

### Example Use Case
- In the Mid Latitude Band on December 20th, sunrise occurs at 7:00 AM BDAS time and sunset at 6:30 PM BDAS time. This consistency holds regardless of the season, ensuring a predictable and healthy photoperiod.

## TODO

### Global Support
- Add support for international users to automatically detect location and latitude.
- Ensure time adjustments are accurate for all global regions.

### Notifications Based on BDAS Time
- Develop functionality to schedule notifications, such as alarms or reminders, using BDAS time.
- Example: Setting a reminder 15 minutes before BDAS sunrise to prepare for a morning activity.

### Health Insights Integration
- Include features to track user health data, such as sleep patterns and energy levels, to demonstrate the benefits of BDAS time.
- Offer personalized recommendations based on circadian rhythm analysis.

### Expanded Visualization
- Add options for more advanced visualizations of time dilation, such as graphs or animations.
- Include widgets for quick access to BDAS time on the home screen.

## Technical Requirements
